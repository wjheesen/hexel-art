Like pixel art, but with hexagons (or "hexels") instead of pixels. The [old version](https://wjheesen.github.io/hexelart/) of the app was last updated in 2017. The [new version](https://wjheesen.github.io/hexel-art/) underway will address shaky zoom issues on mobile and will use WebGL instancing to increase grid size (currently 512 x 512).
